# Linear Regression with Python

The data set contains data of an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online (dummy data) but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. I have tried to implement a simple Linear Regression to figure it out! Let's get started! 

PS: Do let me know if any suggestion or improvements required.
